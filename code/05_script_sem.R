# In this exercise, you will explore relationships among variables
# using covariance and path analysis. You will replicate a published
# path model and propose an alternative.

# 1. For the variables depicted in Figure 22.1, draw a figure
#    showing the covariance between variables.

# 2. Following Figure 22.1, develop a path model using the
#    same variables and relationships. Examine if this model
#    captures the data structure using a Chi-Square test.

# 3. Develop an alternative path model that you consider more
#    appropriate based on theory or observed data patterns.

# 4. Compare the performance of the published model (Figure 22.1)
#    and your alternative model.
#    - Consider fit indices, path coefficients, and interpretability.
