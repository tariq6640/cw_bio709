# DATA GUIDE: Bat Detector Data
# ============================================================

# ----------------------------
# Raw data columns
# ----------------------------

# Site
#   Location where bat detectors are deployed.
#   Levels:
#     "RECCON"  = prairie site without wetland
#     "RECWET"  = prairie site with constructed wetland
#     "WOODCON" = woody site without wetland
#     "WOODWET" = woody site with constructed wetland

# DATE
#   Calendar date of each bat pass record.
#   Expected format: YYYY-MM-DD (verify and standardize).

# TIME
#   Time of bat pass detection.
#   Expected format: HH:MM:SS (verify and standardize).

# AUTO ID*
#   Automatically identified bat species.
#   Species IDs may contain misclassifications or unknown labels
#   that should be carefully reviewed during data cleaning.

# ============================================================
# GOAL 1: Clean data
# ============================================================

# 1. Format column names
#   - Convert column names to a clean format

# 2. Examine each column carefully
#   - Check for missing values, inconsistent formats, and typos
#   - Confirm DATE and TIME are properly parsed as date/time objects
#   - Inspect AUTO ID values for NA
#   - Remove or correct invalid or unusable records as needed

# New derived columns to create:
# Site-level categories:
#   Prairie sites: "RECCON", "RECWET"
#   Woody sites:   "WOODCON", "WOODWET"

# 3. habitat_type
#   Broad site classification:
#     "prairie" = RECCON, RECWET
#     "woody"   = WOODCON, WOODWET

# 4. wetland_status
#   Presence/absence of wetland:
#     "no_wetland" = RECCON, WOODCON
#     "wetland"    = RECWET, WOODWET

# ============================================================
# GOAL 2: Visualize daily bat activity
# ============================================================

# Objective:
#   Quantify and visualize bat activity as the number of bat passes per day.

# Steps:
#   - Aggregate data to calculate daily bat passes
#   - Convert DATE to Julian date
#   - Plot number of bat passes as a function of Julian date
#   - Optionally:
#       * Color or facet plots by site
#       * Smooth trends to visualize seasonal patterns

# ============================================================
# GOAL 3: Model differences among sites
# ============================================================

# Objective:
#   Test whether bat activity differs among the four detector sites.
#   Does the presence of wetland affect bat activity?
#   Is the effect of wetland is site-dependent?

# Modeling considerations:
#   - Response variable: daily bat passes
#   - Predictors may include:
#       * habitat_type
#       * wetland_status
#       * site (four-level factor)
#       * Julian date (to account for seasonality)
#   - Consider appropriate count models
